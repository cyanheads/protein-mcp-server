### `protein_search_structures`

**Search and discover protein structures** from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) using a wide range of criteria.

**Key Features:**

- Free-text search for protein names, keywords, or PDB IDs.
- Filter by source organism, experimental method, and resolution.
- Pagination support for navigating large result sets.
- Returns rich metadata including title, organism, method, and resolution.

**Example Use Cases:**

- "Find all human kinase structures with resolution better than 2.0 √Ö"
- "Show me all cryo-EM structures of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein"
- "List structures of hemoglobin from _Escherichia coli_"

---

### `protein_get_structure`

**Retrieve detailed information** for specific protein structures by their PDB ID.

**Key Features:**

- Fetch single or multiple structures by their 4-character PDB ID.
- Choose between different data formats: `mmCIF` (default), `PDB`, `PDBML`, or `JSON`.
- Selectively include or exclude 3D coordinates, experimental data, and functional annotations.
- Provides access to atomic coordinates, chain information, and experimental details like R-factors and unit cell parameters.

**Example Use Cases:**

- "Get the full structure data for PDB ID 1ABC in mmCIF format"
- "Show me the metadata and chain information for 2GBP, but exclude the coordinates"
- "What were the experimental method and resolution for structure 6M0J?"

---

### `protein_compare_structures`

**Compare and contrast multiple protein structures** to analyze conformational changes and structural relationships.

**Key Features:**

- Side-by-side comparison of 2 to 10 structures.
- Utilizes standard alignment algorithms like `CEAlign` and `TM-Align`.
- Calculates key metrics including RMSD, TM-score, and sequence identity.
- Can optionally generate a visualization script for PyMOL or ChimeraX.

**Example Use Cases:**

- "Compare the active site conformations of HIV protease in structures 1HVR and 1HVS"
- "Align structures 2GBP and 3AXO and report the RMSD"
- "Analyze the conformational differences between the open and closed states of a protein"

---

### `protein_find_similar`

**Discover structurally or sequentially related proteins** based on a query.

**Key Features:**

- Similarity search by `sequence` (like BLAST) or `structure` (like DALI).
- Use a PDB ID, a FASTA sequence, or raw structure data as the query.
- Set thresholds for sequence identity, E-value, TM-score, or RMSD to refine results.
- Identifies homologous proteins, recognizes structural folds, and supports evolutionary analysis.

**Example Use Cases:**

- "Find proteins structurally similar to PDB ID 1ABC"
- "What proteins have a sequence identity greater than 90% to this FASTA sequence?"
- "Discover other proteins with a similar fold to my query structure"

---

### `protein_track_ligands`

**Identify protein structures that bind to specific small molecules**, such as drugs, inhibitors, or cofactors.

**Key Features:**

- Search for ligands by common name, chemical ID, or SMILES string.
- Filter results by the bound protein's name, organism, or experimental method.
- Optionally include details of the binding site, including interacting residues.
- Essential for drug discovery, pharmacology, and molecular docking workflows.

**Example Use Cases:**

- "Find all human protein structures that bind to ATP"
- "Show me structures of Cyclin-dependent kinase 2 in complex with an inhibitor"
- "What are the binding site residues for glucose in hexokinase?"

---

### `protein_analyze_collection`

**Perform statistical analysis** on the entire Protein Data Bank to uncover trends and distributions.

**Key Features:**

- Aggregate data based on `fold` classification, `function`, `organism`, or experimental `method`.
- Apply filters to narrow the analysis to specific subsets of the database.
- Group results by a secondary dimension (e.g., year) to visualize trends over time.

**Example Use Cases:**

- "What are the most common structural folds found in membrane proteins?"
- "Show a yearly trend of the number of structures determined by cryo-EM"
- "Which organisms are most represented in the PDB for the years 2020-2023?"

## ‚ú® Features

This server is built on the [`mcp-ts-template`](https://github.com/cyanheads/mcp-ts-template) and inherits its rich feature set:

- **Declarative Tools**: Define agent capabilities in single, self-contained files. The framework handles registration, validation, and execution.
- **Robust Error Handling**: A unified `McpError` system ensures consistent, structured error responses.
- **Pluggable Authentication**: Secure your server with zero-fuss support for `none`, `jwt`, or `oauth` modes.
- **Abstracted Storage**: Swap storage backends (`in-memory`, `filesystem`, `Supabase`, `Cloudflare KV/R2`) without changing business logic.
- **Full-Stack Observability**: Deep insights with structured logging (Pino) and optional, auto-instrumented OpenTelemetry for traces and metrics.
- **Dependency Injection**: Built with `tsyringe` for a clean, decoupled, and testable architecture.
- **Edge-Ready**: Write code once and run it seamlessly on your local machine or at the edge on Cloudflare Workers.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Agent Development Guide

For a strict set of rules when using this template with an AI agent, please refer to **`AGENTS.md`**. Key principles include:

- **Logic Throws, Handlers Catch**: Never use `try/catch` in your tool/resource `logic`. Throw an `McpError` instead.
- **Use Elicitation for Missing Input**: If a tool requires user input that wasn't provided, use the `elicitInput` function from the `SdkContext` to ask the user for it.
- **Pass the Context**: Always pass the `RequestContext` object through your call stack.
- **Use the Barrel Exports**: Register new tools and resources only in the `index.ts` barrel files.
